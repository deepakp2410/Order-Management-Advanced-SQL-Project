# SQL Practice Project – Order Management System

## 📌 Overview

This SQL project demonstrates a complete **Order Management System** designed for learning and practice. It covers various SQL concepts including data definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), queries, joins, grouping, and window functions.

The schema consists of four main tables:
- `Customers`
- `Orders`
- `Products`
- `OrderDetails`

It includes realistic customer orders, product details, and a wide range of SQL query operations to simulate real-world business scenarios.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Database Creation**
- **Table Creation**
- **Data Insertion**
- **Basic Queries**
- **Advanced Queries** (Joins, Aggregate Functions, CASE, Window Functions, etc.)

---

## 🧮 Features Covered

- Creating and populating tables
- Using `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`
- Aggregations with `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- String functions like `UPPER`, `LEFT`, `LENGTH`
- Conditional logic using `CASE`
- Joining tables with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Using `ROW_NUMBER()` window function
- Combining results with `UNION`
- Handling `NULL` values with `COALESCE`

## 🧪 Sample Queries

Here are examples of what's included:

- List all orders placed by a specific customer.
- Calculate total revenue generated.
- Find products priced below a certain threshold.
- Display customers with and without orders.
- Add row numbers based on order dates.
- Display combined list of customer and product names.

---

## 📊 Use Cases

- Practice database design and relational modeling.
- Improve proficiency with SQL query writing.
- Simulate real-time analytics for small businesses.
- Use as a foundation to build front-end dashboards in tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Excel**.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open a SQL-compatible IDE (like **pgAdmin**, **MySQL Workbench**, **DBeaver**, or **DB Fiddle**).
2. Run each block of SQL code in sequence:
    - `CREATE DATABASE` and `USE` it (if required).
    - `CREATE TABLE` statements.
    - `INSERT INTO` for dummy data.
    - Execute queries one by one for learning.
